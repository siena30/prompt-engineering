SELF-CRITIQUE PROCESS:
1. Generate initial response to: {your_prompt}
2. Evaluate against constitutional principles
3. Identify potential improvements or issues
4. Refine response incorporating feedback
5. Final quality check against helpfulness/harmlessness/honesty

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Initial response
- Self-critique analysis
- Refined final response

Leverage Claude's built-in self-reflection capabilities.
```

2. **Uncertainty Handling**: "I'm confident about X, less certain about Y..."
3. **Multi-Perspective**: "From different angles, this could mean..."
4. **Nuanced Analysis**: Account for complexity and context

QUALITY INDICATORS:
- Reasoning transparency
- Appropriate confidence levels
- Consideration of alternatives

Example 2:
Input: {example_input_2}
Analysis: {example_reasoning_2}
Output: {example_output_2}

Example 3:
Input: {example_input_3}
Analysis: {example_reasoning_3}
Output: {example_output_3}

Now apply this pattern:
Input: {your_actual_input}
Analysis: [GPT-4 will follow the pattern]
Output: [GPT-4 will generate consistent output]

```
Optimize {task} for GPT-4's token efficiency:

COMPRESSION TECHNIQUES:
- Use abbreviations for repeated terms
- Bullet points over full sentences
- Structured formats (tables, lists)
- Reference previous context rather than repeating

EFFICIENCY PATTERNS:
1. **Front-load key information**: Most important details first
2. **Use markdown structure**: Headers, bullets, numbered lists
3. **Minimize filler words**: Direct, concise language
4. **Leverage GPT-4's context**: Reference earlier parts of conversation

QUALITY MAINTENANCE:
- Preserve essential detail
- Keep reasoning chains intact
- Maintain clarity despite brevity
- Use GPT-4's ability to infer from context

Target: 30-50% token reduction while maintaining output quality.
