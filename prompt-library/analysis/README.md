Systematic prompts for deep thinking and problem-solving.

## Problem Solving

### First Principles Analysis
**Tags:** `#expert` `#systematic` `#template`
```
Analyze {problem} using first principles thinking:

```
Research {topic} comprehensively:

Method:
1. Key questions (5 most important)
2. Sources: Primary + secondary
3. Search strategy

5. Synthesis approach

Output format: {executive_summary/report/brief}
```

### Comparative Analysis
**Tags:** `#expert` `#template`
```
Compare {option_a} vs {option_b} for {use_case}:

Framework:
- Criteria: What matters most?
- Scoring: Rate each option (1-10)

- Context: When to choose each
- Recommendation: Winner + reasoning

Be decisively analytical.
```

## Critical Thinking

Mitigation strategies for each found bias.
```

## Data Analysis

### Data Insight Extraction
**Tags:** `#expert` `#template`
```
Extract insights from this data: {data_description}

Analysis approach:
