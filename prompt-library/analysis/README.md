# Analysis Prompts

Systematic prompts for deep thinking and problem-solving.

## Problem Solving

### First Principles Analysis
**Tags:** `#expert` `#systematic` `#template`
```
Analyze {problem} using first principles thinking:

Deconstruction:
1. Core assumptions (what do we take for granted?)
2. Fundamental truths (what's actually proven?)
3. Build up: New approach from basics
4. Comparison: Traditional vs first principles solution

Think like Elon Musk approaching this fresh.
```

### Root Cause Analysis
**Tags:** `#systematic` `#template`
```
Find the root cause of {problem}:

5 Whys Method:
- Why 1: {immediate_cause}
- Why 2: What caused that?
- Why 3: What caused that?
- Why 4: What caused that?  
- Why 5: What caused that?

Root cause + prevention strategy.
```

## Decision Making

### Decision Analysis Framework
**Tags:** `#expert` `#systematic` `#template`
```
Analyze this decision: {decision}

Structure:
- Stakes: What's at risk?
- Options: 3-5 viable paths
- Criteria: Success metrics (weighted)
- Trade-offs: Each option's pros/cons
- Recommendation: Best choice + reasoning
- Reversibility: Can we change course?

Decide like a top consultant.
```

### Scenario Planning
**Tags:** `#systematic` `#template`
```
Plan for {situation} across multiple scenarios:

Scenarios:
- Best case: What if everything goes right?
- Base case: Most likely outcome
- Worst case: What could go wrong?

For each: triggers, implications, response strategy.
```

## Research & Evaluation

### Research Strategy
**Tags:** `#systematic` `#template`
```
Research {topic} comprehensively:

Method:
1. Key questions (5 most important)
2. Sources: Primary + secondary
3. Search strategy
4. Quality filters
5. Synthesis approach

Output format: {executive_summary/report/brief}
```

### Comparative Analysis
**Tags:** `#expert` `#template`
```
Compare {option_a} vs {option_b} for {use_case}:

Framework:
- Criteria: What matters most?
- Scoring: Rate each option (1-10)
- Trade-offs: Where they differ
- Context: When to choose each
- Recommendation: Winner + reasoning

Be decisively analytical.
```

## Critical Thinking

### Argument Evaluation
**Tags:** `#expert` `#quick`
```
Evaluate this argument for logical soundness:
{argument}

Check for:
- Logical fallacies
- Evidence quality  
- Missing assumptions
- Counter-arguments
- Strength rating (1-10)

Think like a philosophy professor.
```

### Bias Detection
**Tags:** `#systematic` `#template`
```
Identify potential biases in {analysis/decision/viewpoint}:

Common biases to check:
- Confirmation bias
- Anchoring bias
- Availability heuristic
- Sunk cost fallacy
- Groupthink

Mitigation strategies for each found bias.
```

## Data Analysis

### Data Insight Extraction
**Tags:** `#expert` `#template`
```
Extract insights from this data: {data_description}

Analysis approach:
- Patterns: What trends emerge?
- Outliers: What's unusual?
- Correlations: What connects?
- Implications: So what?
- Actions: Now what?

Think like a data scientist.
```

### Statistical Reasoning
**Tags:** `#expert` `#quick`
```
Interpret these statistics: {statistics}

Consider:
- Sample size and quality
- Statistical significance
- Practical significance  
- Confounding factors
- Limitations

Translate to plain English insights.
```

## Intelligence Analysis

### CIA-Style Intelligence Analysis
**Tags:** `#expert` `#intelligence` `#systematic`
```
Analyze {situation/threat/opportunity} using structured analytical techniques:

ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK:
1. **Key Assumptions Check**: What must be true for this to matter?
2. **Alternative Hypotheses**: Generate 4-5 competing explanations
3. **Inconsistent Evidence**: What contradicts the leading hypothesis?
4. **Deception Check**: How might we be deliberately misled?

INFORMATION EVALUATION:
- Source credibility: Track record, access, motivation
- Information reliability: Corroboration, logical consistency  
- Recency and relevance: Time-decay factors
- Collection gaps: What don't we know that matters?

BIAS MITIGATION:
- Confirmation bias: Actively seek disconfirming evidence
- Availability heuristic: Weight base rates over vivid examples
- Anchoring: Consider multiple starting points
- Groupthink: Red team the consensus view

CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT:
- High confidence: Multiple independent sources, consistent with patterns
- Moderate confidence: Some gaps but logical consistency
- Low confidence: Limited sources, significant uncertainties

Output: Analytical judgment with confidence intervals and key uncertainties.
Think like a senior CIA analyst briefing the President.
```

### Competitive Intelligence (Fortune 500 Standards)
**Tags:** `#expert` `#business-intelligence` `#systematic`
```
Conduct competitive analysis of {competitor} using enterprise CI methods:

INTELLIGENCE REQUIREMENTS:
1. **Strategic Intent**: Where are they heading? Why?
2. **Capabilities**: What can they actually execute?
3. **Vulnerabilities**: Where are they exposed?
4. **Likely Moves**: What will they do next?

COLLECTION PLAN:
- Primary sources: Earnings calls, conference presentations, job postings
- Secondary sources: Industry reports, patent filings, regulatory submissions
- Human intelligence: Former employees, suppliers, customers
- Technical intelligence: Product teardowns, technology benchmarking

EARLY WARNING SYSTEM:
- Leadership changes: New hires signal strategic shifts
- Investment patterns: R&D, capex, M&A activity
- Partnership announcements: Ecosystem positioning
- Patent applications: Future product capabilities

COUNTERINTELLIGENCE:
- Information security: What are you revealing?
- Deception detection: Are they misleading the market?
- Source protection: Maintaining intelligence access

Deliverable: Monthly CI briefing for executive team.
Think like a Fortune 50 competitive intelligence director.
