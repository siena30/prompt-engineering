## ðŸŒ³ Tree-of-Thought Reasoning

### Tree-of-Thought Problem Solving
**Tags:** `#expert` `#cutting-edge` `#systematic`
```
Solve {complex_problem} using Tree-of-Thought methodology:

STEP 1: THOUGHT GENERATION
Generate 4 distinct solution approaches:
- Approach A: {brief_description}
- Approach B: {brief_description}  
- Approach C: {brief_description}
- Approach D: {brief_description}

STEP 2: THOUGHT EVALUATION
Rate each approach (1-10) on:
- Feasibility: How realistic is implementation?
- Effectiveness: How well does it solve the problem?
- Efficiency: Resource requirements vs. impact
- Risk: What could go wrong?

STEP 3: THOUGHT SELECTION
Select top 2 approaches based on evaluation scores.
Reasoning for selection: {explicit_rationale}

STEP 4: THOUGHT EXPANSION
For each selected approach, generate 3 implementation paths:
- Path 1: Conservative, proven methods
- Path 2: Innovative, higher-risk methods
- Path 3: Hybrid approach combining elements

STEP 5: RECURSIVE EVALUATION
Evaluate each implementation path using same criteria.
Select optimal path or combine insights from multiple paths.

STEP 6: SYNTHESIS
Final recommendation combining best elements from the reasoning tree.

This explores multiple solution spaces systematically, like a chess grandmaster considering move sequences.

## ðŸŽ¯ Constitutional AI Reasoning

### Self-Correcting Analysis Framework
**Tags:** `#expert` `#constitutional-ai` `#self-improving`
```
Apply Constitutional AI principles to analyze {topic}:

INITIAL ANALYSIS:
Generate comprehensive analysis of {topic} focusing on {key_aspects}.

CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW:
Evaluate initial analysis against principles:
1. **Helpfulness**: Does this genuinely help the user make better decisions?
2. **Harmlessness**: Could any recommendations cause unintended negative consequences?
3. **Honesty**: Are uncertainties and limitations clearly acknowledged?
4. **Fairness**: Are all relevant perspectives considered fairly?
5. **Accuracy**: Are claims well-supported by evidence?

SELF-CRITIQUE:
For each constitutional principle, identify specific improvements:
- What information would make this more helpful?
- What risks or harms haven't been considered?
- Where are claims overstated or uncertain?
- Which perspectives are underrepresented?
- What evidence is weak or missing?

REFINED ANALYSIS:
Revise the analysis incorporating constitutional feedback:
- Add missing perspectives and evidence
- Acknowledge uncertainties and limitations  
- Consider broader implications and risks
- Strengthen logical reasoning
- Ensure recommendations are balanced

FINAL VALIDATION:
Rate refined analysis (1-10) on each constitutional principle.
If any principle scores < 8, perform additional refinement.

Self-improving analysis through constitutional alignment.
