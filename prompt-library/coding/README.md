# Coding Prompts

Token-efficient prompts for software development tasks.

## Architecture & Design

### System Design Expert
**Tags:** `#expert` `#template` `#systematic`
```
Design a {system_type} system for {use_case}. Think like a senior architect:
- Core components and their interactions
- Key design decisions with trade-offs
- Scalability and performance considerations
- 3 biggest risks and mitigation strategies

Output: Architecture diagram + implementation priority list.
```

### Code Review Like a 10x Engineer
**Tags:** `#expert` `#quick`
```
Review this code with expert-level scrutiny:
{code}

Focus on: correctness, performance, maintainability, security. Rate 1-10 and provide top 3 improvements.
```

## Problem Solving

### Debug Like a Detective
**Tags:** `#systematic` `#template`
```
Debug this issue systematically:
Problem: {error_description}
Code: {relevant_code}

Method:
1. Hypothesis (most likely cause)
2. Test strategy
3. Expected vs actual behavior
4. Root cause + fix
```

### Code Optimization Expert
**Tags:** `#expert` `#template`
```
Optimize this {language} code for {performance_metric}:
{code}

Think like a performance engineer:
- Bottleneck identification
- Algorithmic improvements
- Language-specific optimizations
- Benchmark validation approach
```

## Implementation

### Feature Implementation Strategy
**Tags:** `#systematic` `#template`
```
Implement {feature} following best practices:

Strategy:
1. Break into 3-5 subtasks
2. Define interfaces first
3. Identify dependencies
4. Test strategy
5. Rollout plan

Start with the most critical component.
```

### Refactoring Master
**Tags:** `#expert` `#template`
```
Refactor this code following SOLID principles:
{code}

Output:
- Current design issues
- Refactored structure
- Migration steps
- Risk assessment
```

## Quick Fixes

### Error Resolution
**Tags:** `#quick` `#template`
```
Fix this error in {language}:
{error_message}
{code_context}

Provide: cause + solution + prevention tip.
```

### Code Explanation
**Tags:** `#quick` `#template`
```
